# Hello guys

I am a French student in heavy-duty mechanics (bus), no relation with development actually. Development for me is a hobby, I only code ~15 hours per week, on weekends. I am learning by myself to use programming languages, I have read courses only for SQL and soon Java, maybe Python...
If you see that I am making mistakes, that you have suggestions, or simply if you just want to talk; Send me an email: vincent.bernhardt67@gmail.com
Or with a wild ghost (snap): vb67290

I love Node.js.
